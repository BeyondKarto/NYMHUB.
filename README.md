# NYMHUB.

Welcome to NYMHUB – a collaborative knowledge hub for our Nym community. Built on Git, NYMHUB will be an evolving resource, inviting every Nymja to contribute and shape its content. This space will bring together guides, events, and tools that empower our network. Here’s a preview of the sections planned:

	•	Guides: Step-by-step instructions on installing, migrating, and managing nodes, along with other technical resources.
	•	Events: A comprehensive list of all upcoming and past events, whether online or offline.
	•	Services: A toolkit of Nym-related services, including Telegram bots, explorers, and more.
	•	Regional Channels: Resources and channels curated for specific regions, catering to localized needs.

Additional sections:

	•	Nym Link Repository: A centralized access point to Nym’s key links, including socials, GitHub, documentation, explorers, NymVPN, blog, and more.
	•	Squad Repository: A dedicated space for team collaboration, perfect for sharing updates and coordinating across the Nym network.

Let’s build NYMHUB together! Join us in creating a resource that will enhance Nym’s accessibility, visibility, and collaboration across the community.
